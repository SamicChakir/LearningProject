the Hearst Entertainment documentaries archive.

During the 1990s, History was jokingly referred to as "The Hitler Channel" for its extensive coverage of World War II.
Much of its military-themed programming has been shifted to its sister network Military History.

A&E Networks considered History to be the driver in international expansion due to a lack of international rights to A&E international co-productions.
As expected, the History Channel led A&E's overseas expansion in Brazil with TVA (April 1996), the Nordic and Baltic regions with Modern Times Group (1997), and in Canada (1997).

History expanded in 1998 into tours of U.S. landmarks with Mayflower Tours having an affiliated website (historytravel.com), History Channel Traveler, and a planned quarterly magazine.
While in October, History and MSG Network teamed up to produce several short-form sports history programs. A+E spun out in November 1998 History Channel International from the History Channel.


History's logo, used from February 16, 2008, to May 31, 2015: The new logo does not have the triangle on the side of the H.
On February 16, 2008, a new logo was launched on the U.S. network as part of a rebranding effort.
While the trademark "H" was kept, the triangle shape on the left acts as a play button for animation and flyouts during commercials and shows.
On March 20, 2008, as part of that same rebranding effort, The History Channel dropped "The" and "Channel" from its name to become simply "History".

The "History 100" documentary initiative was announced in March 2018 that would produce 100 documentaries covering major events and notable figures from last 100 years.
